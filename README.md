Hi, I'm Harnam. <br>
Recently finished secondary school. I did GCSE English, Maths, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Electronics, Computer Science, History, and Economics. <br>
I love maths, physics, chemistry, computer science etc... <br>
I'm substantially self taught - have been teaching myself maths and physics since 8 years old. <br>
Started programming with scratch (~7 years old) and HTML and JavaScript (10 years old). <br>
Taught myself how to design basic electronics at 10, alongside some theory. <br>
 <br>
I've taken up reading, and am now addicted. In the past year having read more than 5 books all on maths and physics (and some computer science). <br>
 <br>
My best work is my proof of (CASIO's) non-programmable calculators being Turing complete. Accomplished by writing a Turing machine using basic mathematical statements.
